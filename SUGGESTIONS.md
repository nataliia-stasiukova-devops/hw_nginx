# Suggestions

### Project
- Missing files: 
  - CONTRIBUTORS.md

### README
- Missing link to
  - CONTRIBUTORS.md

### SCRIPT
- many commands are used with out validation that it will work on the system :
  - apt: are you sure it exists ?
- as mentioned too many time in the class: do not use [], use [[]] instead 
- as mentioned, it is preferable to use template files, instead of EOF/EOL embedings in the file script
- as mentioned at class: when using tool, you need to verify that it exists => what if curl is not installed ?
